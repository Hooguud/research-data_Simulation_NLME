## The raw data of the paper "Digital Quantum Simulation of the Nonlinear Lindblad Master Equation Based on Quantum Trajectory Averaging"
### The data is saved in the .jld format. When reading it using a Julia program, you need to load the packages "JLD" and "HDF5". Then, you can use the corresponding command such as load("Fig2a.jld") to read the data. Here we present a Julia plotting script, “Example_Fig2a.jl”, which is used to generate FIG.2.(a).
