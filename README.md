## The raw data of the paper "Digital Quantum Simulation of the Lindblad Master Equation and Its Nonlinear Extensions via Quantum Trajectory Averaging"
### The data is saved in the .jld format. When reading it using a Julia program, you need to load the packages "JLD" and "HDF5". Then, you can use the corresponding command such as load to read the data. Here we present the Julia plotting script, “Plot_Fig.3a.jl” and “Plot_Fig.3b.jl”, which is used to generate FIG.3.(a) and FIG.3.(b).
